Dependencies:
I used Python 3.8.2.
I was able to install pysat python library on pyrite using:
$ pip install --user python-sat

Running the program:
The program takes in an input file that contains the matrix with the taxa names and can be run as:
./SATpipeline.sh matrixFileName -arg
where arg can be a or r where 
-a means we add and remove rows to find a solution
-r means to we only remove rows 

Example:
./SATpipeline.sh irus.txt -a
./SATpipeline.sh ficus -r

Output files:
If the program takes a file named "matrix" as its input, it will always output the following files:
matrixStripped - matrix without taxa names
matrixReduced - matrix with repeated rows removed
matrixReducedResults - decisive matrix in reduced forms
matrixFinalResults - decisive matrix with duplicate rows added back in (if they are present in the reduced decisive matrix)
matrixSummary.txt - file containing info about result sizes and timing results

(I believe the add method outputs an additional file with timing information)



Please note the program is not cleaned and still has print statements,unused functions, commented out old code, etc.
