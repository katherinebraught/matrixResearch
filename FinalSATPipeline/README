Dependencies:
I used Python 3.8.2.
I was able to install pysat python library on pyrite using:
$ pip install --user python-sat

Running the program:
The program takes in an input file that contains the matrix with the taxa names and can be run as:
./SATpipeline.sh matrixFileName -arg
where arg can be a or r where 
-a means we add and remove rows to find a solution
-r means to we only remove rows 

Example:
./SATpipeline.sh irus.txt -a
./SATpipeline.sh ficus -r
